Runs the app in the development mode and opens a browser window to http://localhost:3000

The page will reload if you make edits.

## How to Play the Game
The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score will increment when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score will reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.

Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game will restart at zero.
